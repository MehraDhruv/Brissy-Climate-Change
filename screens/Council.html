            <h2>🏛️ What is Brisbane City Council Doing About Climate Change?</h2>
          
            <p>
              Brisbane City Council recognises that climate change is not just a distant threat — it’s a <strong>local and immediate challenge</strong>. From more intense storms and floods to hotter days and environmental degradation, the impacts of a changing climate are already being felt by Brisbane communities.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              That’s why the Council has committed to an ambitious and science-based climate agenda focused on two core goals:
            </p>
          
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mitigating carbon emissions</strong> – reducing the city's contribution to climate change.</li>
              <li><strong>Building resilience</strong> – preparing the city for unavoidable environmental impacts.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>1. Leading the Transition to Clean Energy</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Solar Energy Expansion</strong>: Rooftop solar panels on Council buildings to reduce grid dependency.</li>
              <li><strong>Green Energy Procurement</strong>: Purchasing certified renewable electricity for operations.</li>
              <li><strong>Energy Efficiency Upgrades</strong>: LED lighting, smart meters, and energy-saving appliances installed citywide.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>🏙️ Brisbane aims to achieve <strong>net-zero emissions</strong> for its operations by 2032.</blockquote>
          
            <h3>2. Greener, Smarter Transport for All</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Electric Buses</strong> on major routes for cleaner transit.</li>
              <li><strong>Expanded Bike Lanes</strong> and walking paths for sustainable commuting.</li>
              <li><strong>Public EV Charging Stations</strong> supporting electric vehicle uptake.</li>
              <li><strong>Smart Public Transport Planning</strong> for a more accessible and efficient system.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>🚲 A cleaner transport future starts with everyday choices — and Council is making those choices easier.</blockquote>
          
            <h3>3. Urban Greening and Biodiversity Protection</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tree Planting Programs</strong> across streets and parks.</li>
              <li><strong>Habitat Protection</strong> for native species like koalas and gliders.</li>
              <li><strong>Green Infrastructure</strong> including green rooftops and vertical gardens.</li>
              <li><strong>Brisbane Offsets Program</strong> ensuring a net gain in tree canopy coverage.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>🌿 Green cities are healthier cities — for both people and wildlife.</blockquote>
          
            <h3>4. Moving Towards a Zero-Waste Brisbane♻️ </h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Improved Recycling Systems</strong> and education.</li>
              <li><strong>Composting and Organics Initiatives</strong> for households and communities.</li>
              <li><strong>Sustainable Procurement</strong> across Council operations.</li>
              <li><strong>Education Campaigns</strong> to reduce food waste and single-use plastics.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>♻️ “Waste less, recycle more” isn’t just a slogan — it’s a city-wide mission.</blockquote>
          
            <h3>5. Building a Climate-Resilient Brisbane</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Flood Mitigation Projects</strong> including stormwater upgrades.</li>
              <li><strong>Urban Heat Management</strong> through trees and reflective materials.</li>
              <li><strong>Emergency Management Strategies</strong> for storms, heatwaves, and bushfires.</li>
              <li><strong>Community Resilience Programs</strong> to help locals prepare their homes and suburbs.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>🛠️ Investing in climate resilience today reduces future risks and recovery costs.</blockquote>
          
            <h3>6. Engaging, Educating, and Empowering the Community</h3>

            </ul>
            <blockquote>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Together, we can create a more sustainable and climate-safe Brisbane.</blockquote>

              🌏 Climate change is a challenge no city can ignore — and Brisbane City Council is rising to that challenge. But the journey to a cleaner, safer, and more liveable future depends on every citizen. Together, let’s make Brisbane a climate action leader, one community at a time.
